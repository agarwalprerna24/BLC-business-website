The Apex Court in Jan De Nul Dredging India Pvt. Ltd. v. Tuticorin Port Trust (2026 INSC 34) emphasised that once an arbitral tribunal adopts a plausible and reasoned interpretation of contractual clauses, courts exercising powers under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 cannot re-appreciate evidence or substitute their own views.","The dispute stemmed from a contract where the arbitral tribunal awarded compensation towards idling charges of equipment. While a Single Judge of the High Court upheld the award, a Division Bench interfered by preferring a different contractual interpretation. Setting aside the appellate decision, the Supreme Court clarified that appellate courts do not possess ordinary appellate jurisdiction over arbitral findings and may intervene only on narrowly defined statutory grounds such as patent illegality or conflict with public policy.","Restoring the arbitral award, the Court underscored that arbitration is designed to ensure finality and efficiency in commercial dispute resolution, and excessive judicial interference would defeat the legislative intent of the statute. The ruling strengthens the principle that reasoned arbitral interpretations deserve judicial deference unless they fall within the limited exceptions expressly recognised by law."]},{header:"Transparency Over Technicality: Telangana High Court Limits Rule 9 Forfeiture in SARFAESI Auctions.",data:["The Telangana High Court in K. Indra Mohan v. Union of India &amp; Ors., W.P. No. 14530 of 2025 has clarified that Rule 9 of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 cannot be invoked by a secured creditor when material facts and pending court orders are suppressed from an auction purchaser. In the case of K. Indra Mohan vs. Union Bank of India, the Court observed that Rule 9 presumes a “clean and transparent sale,” and therefore cannot be used as a shield by banks that fail to make full disclosure of ongoing litigation or restraint orders.","The dispute arose after the auction purchaser deposited 25% of the sale consideration, while the Bank simultaneously pursued recovery from the guarantor and did not adequately communicate existing High Court restraint orders. The Bench held that such conduct amounted to lack of probity and unjust enrichment, emphasizing that transparency and fairness are fundamental obligations of secured creditors in e-auction proceedings.","Consequently, while the High Court declined to compel the Bank to complete the sale, it directed refund of the 25% deposit to the purchaser, reinforcing that forfeiture under Rule 9(5) is impermissible where the creditor itself is at fault. The judgment strengthens the protection of the bidder in SARFAESI auctions and underscores the duty of full and timely disclosure by financial institutions."]},{header:"Telangana High Court Recognises Social Media Complaints as Valid Customer Feedback",data:["The Telangana High Court in S. Mathura Prasad &amp; Sons v. Union of India &amp; Ors., W.P. No. 34055 of 2024 has held that customer complaints made on social media platforms such as ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) constitute a valid and acceptable mode of registering grievances against service providers. The Court observed that in today’s digital environment, such complaints cannot be dismissed as informal or lacking seriousness merely because they are not in traditional written form.","The ruling arose from a challenge by a railway vendor whose catering licence at Secunderabad Railway Station was terminated after multiple complaints regarding poor food quality, overcharging, and misconduct were posted online. The Court noted that the authorities had issued several prior warnings and provided opportunities to rectify deficiencies, thereby satisfying the principles of natural justice and contractual penalty procedures.","Upholding the termination order, the Court emphasized that digital consumer feedback is a legitimate trigger for administrative action, particularly where public health and service standards are involved. The judgment reinforces accountability of service providers in the age of social media while clarifying that due process remains essential before imposing penalties."]},{header:"NCLAT: Employment Dues Disputes Beyond IBC Jurisdiction",data:["The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), New Delhi in Manoj Seth v. Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd., Company Appeal (AT) (Ins.) No. 2213 of 2024 held that disputes arising out of employment agreements, including claims relating to salary, retention pay, and service benefits, cannot be adjudicated by the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The Appellate Tribunal reaffirmed that the IBC is not intended to function as a debt recovery mechanism forcontractual employment disputes.","The case concerned a former employee who initiated insolvency proceedings under Section 9 of the IBC seeking unpaid salary and benefits under an internal allowance scheme. The Tribunal observed that there existed multiple inconsistencies in the claimed amounts and a genuine pre-existing dispute regarding entitlement under the employment contract and company policy. Such contested issues, the Bench noted, require detailed evidence and cannot be resolved through summary insolvency proceedings.","Dismissing the appeal, the NCLAT emphasised that complex service-related disputes must be pursued before appropriate civil, labour, or arbitral forums, and not through the insolvency framework. The judgment reinforces the principle that the IBC’s objective is resolution of insolvency and not adjudication of employer-employee payment conflicts."]},{header:"NCLT Hyderabad Clarifies Scope of Inquiry at Section 7 IBC Admission Stage",data:["The National Company Law Tribunal, Hyderabad Bench in Omkara Assets Reconstruction Pvt. Ltd. v. GS Megha Constructions Pvt. Ltd., CP (IB) No. 138/7/HDB/2024 held that at the admission stage under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, the Adjudicating Authority is only required to examine the existence of a financial debt and the occurrence of default, and not delve into complex factual or contractual disputes. The Tribunal reiterated that insolvency proceedings are summary in nature and cannot be converted into a civil trial.","Rejecting objections regarding the legality of debt assignment and pending internal arbitration among shareholders, the Bench observed that assignment of debt is a recognised mode of transfer under the IBC, and challenges to the validity of such assignment fall outside the limited jurisdiction of the NCLT. The Tribunal further held that One-Time Settlement (OTS) proposals and their rejection do not constitute a “dispute,” but rather operate as acknowledgments of liability, thereby strengthening the creditor’s case of continuing default."]}]};export{e as default};
